# Arduino-Hotkeys

**CURRENT BUILD: UNFINISHED**

Short lil' personal project. Very dirty code. Uses 7 buttons (in my case microswitches), 3 as media keys, and 4 as hotkeys for desktop to make some tasks easier.

Currently only designed for Arduino UNO, and because of hardware limitations and lack of code consolidation/simplification, it can only support up to 7 with LEDs, or 9 without LEDS or if you have a MEGA. I'm going to optimize a lot of the 16u2 code as that is the main limitation of the program.

**This project uses [NicoHood's HoodLoader2](https://github.com/NicoHood/HoodLoader2) bootloader and [HID](https://github.com/NicoHood/HID) library. Great big thanks to him for his simply fantastic software!!**
